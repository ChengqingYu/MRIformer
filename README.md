# MRIformer
The main code of our proposed multiresolution interactive transformer. Its corresponding paper is 《MRIformer: A multi-resolution interactive transformer for wind speed multi-step prediction》.

For commercial reasons, the original code and data cannot be open sourced. In this version, we modified some of the structure of the code to ensure that it can run on public datasets (ETT dataset, PEMS and others).

This repository stores the main model files. If you want to evaluate the performance of the model on other public datasets, please use the following links: https://github.com/ChengqingYu/BasicTS

If the code is helpful to you, please cite the following paper:
